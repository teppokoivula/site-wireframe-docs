# site-wireframe-docs

This is a ProcessWire site profile based on the documentation site of the wireframe output framework,
mainly intended as an example of how one might use wireframe on a real website. Code and modules are
identical to the real docs site, but page content has been replaced with lorem ipsum placeholders.

* For more details about the wireframe output framework, visit https://wireframe-framework.com.
* For more details regarding the ProcessWire CMS/CMF itself, visit https://processwire.com.

to this repository. If your problem or question is related to the wireframe framework, please submit
an issue to the [wireframe repository](https://github.com/teppokoivula/wireframe). Thanks!
